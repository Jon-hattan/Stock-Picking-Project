# Stock-Picking-Project

Personal implementation of the **AlphaAgents** paper to learn about multi-agent systems in finance.

## What This Is

Experimenting with the intersection of AI agents and financial analysis by building a multi-agent system that:
- Uses three specialized AI agents (Fundamental, Sentiment, Valuation)
- Collaborates and debates to analyze stocks
- Makes portfolio decisions through consensus

Based on: [AlphaAgents: Large Language Model based Multi-Agents for Equity Portfolio Constructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11152) (BlackRock, 2025)


## Learning Goals

- Understanding multi-agent systems and AutoGen framework
- Applying LLMs to financial analysis
- Exploring agent collaboration vs. debate mechanisms
- Risk tolerance modeling in AI agents
- Portfolio construction and backtesting

## Tech Stack

Python • AutoGen • GPT-4o • LangChain • Free APIs (SEC EDGAR, Finnhub, yfinance)
